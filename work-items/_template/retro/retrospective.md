## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the retrospectives conducted throughout the feature development lifecycle. Each phase has a detailed retrospective entry (RET-###) that captures specific learnings, challenges, and action items.

**Purpose**: Synthesize cross-phase insights and track overall feature success.

**How to Use**: Each agent creates their phase retrospective (RET-###) using the template. The retro agent then synthesizes all entries into this summary document.
