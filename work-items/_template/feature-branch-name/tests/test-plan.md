# Test Plan

Link back to APR section 8 once this is drafted. Keep it lightweight but explicit so coding + QA stay aligned.

## 1. Test Scope

- Components/APIs covered
- Exclusions

## 2. Strategy

- **Unit tests:** <!-- files/functions to cover -->
- **Integration/API tests:**
- **E2E/Playwright flows:**
- **Manual / exploratory focus areas:**

## 3. Environments & Data

- Required seed data / fixtures
- Feature flags or config toggles

## 4. Tooling & Commands

- Scripts to run (`npm test`, `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run verify:all`, etc.)
- Any custom PowerShell scripts once we add them

## 5. Exit Criteria

- Coverage targets met (70%+ overall, higher for critical paths)
- No P0/P1 bugs open
- Observability dashboards updated (if applicable)
