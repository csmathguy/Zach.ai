# Feature Workspace Template

Rename this folder to match your feature branch (e.g., `feat-health-cards`). Populate each subdirectory as you move through the workflow:

1. **plan/** – Draft the APR/PRD and align stakeholders.
2. **tests/** – Define the verification strategy before heavy coding.
3. **dev/** – Track implementation notes, manual verification, and open risks.
4. **retro/** – Run a retrospective and log improvement actions.

Once copied, everything inside your feature folder (except the template) is ignored by git, letting you iterate quickly without polluting commits.
