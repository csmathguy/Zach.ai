# Feature Folder Template

Copy `feature-branch-name/` to bootstrap a new feature workspace. Keep this directory untouched so it can serve as the canonical template.

Structure overview:

- `plan/apr.md` – Architectural/feature definition document (PRD/APR hybrid).
- `tests/test-plan.md` – Notes for unit, integration, and E2E coverage.
- `dev/implementation-notes.md` – Design spikes, implementation decisions, risk tracking.
- `retro/retrospective.md` – Post-work reflection + improvement actions.
