# Retrospective

Use these prompts after the feature ships (or when you stop work). Capture insights that lead to updates in the knowledge base, agents, prompts, or skills.

## 1. Quick Summary

- Outcome:
- Date range:
- Participants:

## 2. What Went Well?

Celebrate wins (delivery, collaboration, tooling, tests).

## 3. What Was Painful or Missing?

- Information we wished we had upfront (requirements, data, approvals)
- Architecture or guideline gaps
- Tooling limitations / manual toil

## 4. Learnings & Experiments

- What did we learn (technical, product, process)?
- Which experiments should we try next time?

## 5. Improvements & Actions

| Category       | Action                        | Owner | Target Date |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Knowledge base | Update doc/guide              |       |             |
| Agents/Skills  | Adjust instructions/tool sets |       |             |
| Tooling        | Script or automation idea     |       |             |

## 6. Follow-ups

List tasks that must roll into the backlog/issue tracker.

> Inspired by standard retro practices (e.g., 4Ls, What went well/wrong/learned/changes) to keep the loop tight each cycle.
