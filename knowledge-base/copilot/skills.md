# Skills: Terminology Update

We previously used “skills” as a catch‑all term for Copilot capabilities (tools, prompts, agents). GitHub Copilot now supports formal Agent Skills — portable folders of instructions and resources that agents load automatically when relevant.

What to use:

- Agent Skills: See [copilot/agent-skills.md](knowledge-base/copilot/agent-skills.md) for setup, structure, and best practices.
- Tools: See [copilot/tools/overview.md](knowledge-base/copilot/tools/overview.md) for built‑in, extension, and MCP tools.
- Prompts & Agents: See [copilot/prompts/overview.md](knowledge-base/copilot/prompts/overview.md) and [copilot/agents/overview.md](knowledge-base/copilot/agents/overview.md).
