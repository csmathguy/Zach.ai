# Summary: Copilot in VS Code

Core capabilities we’ll leverage:

- Inline suggestions: Speed up coding with contextual completions.
- Natural language chat: Ask, explain, refactor, and apply edits across files.
- Autonomous agents: Plan and execute multi-step tasks, invoke tools, run terminals.
- Tools (skills): Extend chat with built-in, extension, and MCP tools; explicitly reference with `#toolName`.
- Customization: Custom agents, prompt files, custom instructions, and model selection.

How Zach.ai will use this:

- Establish custom agents for planning, implementation, and review with handoffs.
- Maintain a small, well-curated set of tools and MCP servers for reliability.
- Standardize prompts for common workflows (scaffolding, reviews, tests).
- Track security and approvals (tools, URLs, terminal) as part of our defaults.
