# Summary: Anthropic / Claude

Focus areas we’ll leverage alongside Copilot:

- Claude Code: agentic coding, repo-aware assistance in editor contexts.
- Prompting and workflows: reusable patterns for spec → plan → implement → review.
- Tools/connectors (MCP partners): extend capabilities via external systems.

How we’ll use it:

- Maintain Claude-centric prompts and guidance distinct from Copilot specifics.
- Reference Claude’s connectors (MCP partners) where we need external data.
- Track model/feature updates via Claude Code and platform docs.
