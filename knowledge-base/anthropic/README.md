# Anthropic (Claude) Knowledge Base

This section captures Claude/Anthropic concepts, practices, and references separate from Copilot.

Sections:

- summary.md — What Claude provides for coding and agent workflows.
- best-practices.md — Prompting, tools/connectors, safety.
- references.md — Topic → link map to authoritative docs.
- skills.md — Notes on “skills”-like capabilities and where to learn more.

Scope: supportive references for Claude concepts (skills, prompts, connectors). Copilot (VS Code) remains our primary environment; cross-links from Copilot point here when conceptual guidance helps.
